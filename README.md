An awesome list of proteomics tools and resources

I've been analyzing large scale proteomics data sets for over 5 years now. I've recently stumbled upon these awesome lists and wanted to make an in-depth one for proteomics.


## Proteomics 

### Table of Contents 
1. Learning Resources
2. Databases
3. DDA search algorithms
4. Pipeline tools
5. R Packages for Raw Data Analysis
6. R Packages for Stastical Analysis
7. R packages for Protein Pathway Enrichment
8. R Packages for Kinase Motif/Activity Analysis



## 1. Leaning Resources

[Proteomics blog](https://proteomicsnews.blogspot.com/) - hands down the best protomeics blog I've seen. Ben Orsburn is very knowledgable with a great sense of humor

[Review article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm1468) - great proteomics review article

[Tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0v4sjdXLMa-OWR7IYeoFoA/videos) - videos from NCQBCS, a project lead by the Coon lab. Contains lots of information regarding Experimental design, ionization, quantitative proteomics, analysis, post-translational modifications and more.

## 2. Databases

Commonly used protoemics data repoitories. You can find raw data here, or publish your down for article publication requirements. 

[ProteomeXchange](http://www.proteomexchange.org/) - proteomeXchange is a global repository that contains links to all major databases, including MassIVE, Pride, iProX and more. Probably the best place to start.

[Pride database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/)


This massive master list of databses from Pastel BioScience

http://www.pastelbioscience.co.uk/resources/databases.html - this list contains so much useful information that I'm sure the rest of my awesome list will be redundant

[Uniprot](https://www.uniprot.org/)
